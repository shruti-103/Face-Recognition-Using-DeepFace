# Face-Recognition-Using-DeepFace
Face recognition is among the foremost productive image processing applications and incorporates a pivotal role within the technical field. Recognition of the human face is a vigorous issue for authentication purposes specifically within the context of attendance of students. Attendance system using face recognition could be a procedure of recognizing students by using face biostatistics supported the high definition monitoring and other computer technologies. The development of this technique is aimed to accomplish digitization of the standard system of taking attendance by calling names and maintaining pen-paper records. Present strategies for taking attendance are tedious and time-consuming. Attendance records may be easily manipulated by manual recording. The standard process of creating attendance and present biometric systems are susceptible to proxies. After face recognition attendance reports are generated and stored in excel format. The system is tested under various conditions like illumination, head movements, the variation of distance between the student and cameras. After vigorous testing overall complexity and accuracy are calculated. The Proposed system proved to be an efficient and robust device for taking attendance in an exceedingly classroom with none time consumption and manual work. The system developed is cost-efficient and need less installation.
